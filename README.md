# RF-GAP-Python
Python code for Random Forest-Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving Proximities

This package can be used to generate three types of random forest proximities which are described in the paper “Random Forest- Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving Proximities” (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089875). A R-language version of this code is available at \url{https://github.com/jakerhodes/RF-GAP-R}

This repository is still under construction. Additional features will be added to run proximity-based applications.
